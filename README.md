Object detection and Annotation for autonomous vehicle safety

Object detection in video plays a crucial role in enhancing road safety and advancing autonomous systems. The ability to accurately and efficiently identify objects in real-time video streams is fundamental for the development of intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicles. Improving the accuracy and efficiency of object detection directly contributes to reducing accidents and enhancing the overall safety of road users. The ethical considerations explored in this project, such as bias and the impact of false detections, are vital for ensuring responsible and trustworthy AI deployment in safety-critical applications, addressing concerns about fairness and accountability in autonomous decision-making. This project contributes to the development of more reliable and safer autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. 

The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a real-time object detection and annotation framework tailored for road safety applications. The key objectives are: 

To evaluate the performance of different deep learning-based object detection architectures (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SSD) for identifying traffic-related objects in video streams. 

To implement and utilize efficient bounding box annotation techniques for preparing high-quality training datasets. 

To optimize selected object detection models for real-time inference on computationally constrained platforms using techniques such as quantization, TensorRT, and OpenVINO. 

To integrate object detection with multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., SORT, DeepSORT, ByteTrack) to improve the consistency and reliability of object tracking across video frames. 

To analyze and address ethical concerns related to the deployment of AI-driven object detection systems in autonomous vehicles, including model bias and the implications of false positives and false negatives on road safety.
